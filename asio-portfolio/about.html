        Over the years, I’ve developed skills in web and mobile application development, exploring both front-end and back-end work. I’ve gained experience in creating websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
         as well as working with databases and system design to build more complete solutions. Through my projects, I’ve learned how important it is to focus on usability and performance, 
         and I enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into functional applications. I also make it a priority to learn new technologies along the way, so I can continue improving and adapting to the ever-changing IT field.

      <h1>A Brief History<span class="dot">...</span></h1>
      <p>
        My journey in technology started with curiosity. I first explored simple web projects, and that initial spark quickly grew into a passion for programming. Over time, I dove deeper into system development, 
        database design, and full-stack projects, realizing how much I enjoy solving problems and creating tools that make life easier. <br>  
        
        <br>
        While I still love hobbies like reading, cooking, and listening to music, programming has become my main focus and the career path I want to pursue. It’s not just about building software, 
        it’s about creating something meaningful and continuously growing as a professional in the field of IT.
